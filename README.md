This is demo project to test how jenkins pull code from Github



1) In your Desktop you have one folder named JenkinsExample/jenkins

2) Do some changes in it and push it to github

Now you don't need to do anything, open jenkins and  you don't even need to click build button, jenkins will automatically build it after  1 minute (if you have given * * * * * in your bulid trigger option) and changes will be reflected on your console of jenkins.


This project has another branch named pipeline which tells how to pull code from githhub using pipeline(local storage=Desktop/JenkinsExample/jenkins2)
